# SalonCustomerMgt
This App assumes that a hair-dressing salon operator wants to collect the contacts of his customers.
He wants his customers to enter their details on this App so he can always reach out to them.
His intention is to send them season's greetings and other greetings during some general celebrations and even birthdays.
He manages the database and has unrestricted privileges to see all data.
The customers have limited privileges, only to add, view, update and delete their data.
The home page is for customer login or new account creation. 
There, the salon operator can also log in through the 'Admin'
